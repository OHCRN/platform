# UI for the OHCRN Consent Portal

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To start just a local UI server, from the [`ui`](../ui/) directory, run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

To start both a local UI and an API server, run the above command from the root directory.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Montserrat, a custom Google Font.
